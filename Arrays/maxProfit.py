# You are given an array/list 'prices' where the elements of the array represent the prices of the stock 
# as they were yesterday and indices of the array represent minutes. 
# Your task is to find and return the maximum profit you can make by buying and selling the stock. 
# You can buy and sell the stock only once.

# Note:

# You canâ€™t sell without buying first.
# For Example:
# For the given array [ 2, 100, 150, 120],
# The maximum profit can be achieved by buying the stock at minute 0 when its price is Rs. 2 
# and selling it at minute 2 when its price is Rs. 150.
# So, the output will be 148.

#     #     left += 1
#     print(max_profit)
#     right += 1

# for i in arr:
#     if arr[right] - i > max_profit:
#         max_profit = arr[right] - i
